Design/Architectural Decisions:

1. Exception Handling: Used AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) design pattern for centralized exception handling with `@RestControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` annotations.

2. Spring Boot Framework: Used convention over configuration design principle provided by Spring Boot for quick project setup and configuration.

3. JPA Auditing: Used Active Record design pattern for automatic population of certain fields like `createdAt` and `modifiedAt`.

4. Maven for Dependency Management: Followed Dependency Inversion Principle for reducing coupling between modules.

5. Spring Boot Application: Used Spring Boot Application pattern for the main entry point of the application.

6. Custom Exceptions: Used Exception Propagation design pattern for handling various scenarios during the game play.

7. Game Service: Created a GameService class to handle game creation and game play logic.

8. Player Cash System: Added a cash system to the Player class to manage player's cash.

9. Roll Dice and Land: Implemented a method in GameService to simulate dice roll and landing on a place.

10. Purchase Place: Added a purchase method in the Place class to handle place purchase when a player lands on it.

11. Pay Rent: Added a payRent method in the Place class to handle rent payment when a player lands on a place owned by another player.

12. Extendable Player Management: Created a PlayerService class to manage players dynamically as the number of players increases.

13. Scalable Game Board: Designed the game board to handle any number of players.

14. Gain Cash on Crossing Start: Implemented a feature to give players a cash bonus when they cross the start.

15. Declare Winner: Implemented a method to declare the winner based on bankruptcy or the player with the highest cash before turn 50.

16. Database Data Persistence: Used Spring Data JPA for database data persistence to allow the game to be played uninterrupted even if the application is restarted.

17. Design Patterns: Used various design patterns like Factory, Singleton, and Strategy for a highly maintainable and readable code base.

18. Documentation: Used Javadoc and comments for a highly maintainable and readable code base.
